# DFIR-Memory-Dump-Analysis
DFIR memory dump analysis using Volatility to recover credentials and extract data from KeePass.
DFIR memory dump analysis using the Volatility Framework.
This project focuses on investigating a system memory image to recover sensitive information related to a user who frequently uses web browsers and password managers such as KeePass.
The analysis includes inspecting environment variables, identifying suspicious artifacts, extracting a password hidden inside a PNG file, and using it to unlock a KeePass database found in memory.
The memory dump file is not included due to size limitations, but screenshots and analysis notes are provided to demonstrate the investigation process.
